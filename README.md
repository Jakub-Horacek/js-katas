# Elixeum JavaScript Katas
Welcome to the Elixeum Series of JavaScript tasks! ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository is a collection of JavaScript Katas designed to enhance my Vanilla JS skills and is exclusively shared with other members of the Elixeum Katas program.

## Purpose
The primary goal of this series is to sharpen my Vanilla JS skills. As part of Elixeum's initiative to foster continuous learning, these katas serve as a freetime activity for me and my fellow Elixeum Katas program members.

## Guidelines
- **Vanilla JS Only:** Stick to pure JavaScript without the use of AI, JavaScript libraries, or frameworks.
- **Private Repository:** This repository is not open for public contribution. It is shared exclusively among members of the Elixeum Katas program, and contributions are not allowed.
- Each Kata has its own ```instructions.md``` file with instructions for the specific JS kata.

> [!NOTE]  
> Unfortunately JS modules only work via HTTP(s), so for some Katas which are using JS modules you'll need to use a local web server.
