# JavaScript Katas

Welcome to the series of JavaScript tasks! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository is a collection of JavaScript Katas designed to enhance my Vanilla JS skills and is exclusively shared with other members of the Katas program.
It used to be a part of the [Elixeum](https://elixeum.com/) Katas program, but now it is a standalone project.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this series is to sharpen my Vanilla JS skills. These katas serve as a freetime activity for me and my fellow Katas program members.

## Guidelines

- **Vanilla JS Only:** Stick to pure JavaScript without the use of AI, JavaScript libraries, or frameworks.
- **Private Repository:** This repository is not open for public contribution. It is shared exclusively among members of the Elixeum Katas program, and contributions are not allowed.
- Each Kata has its own `instructions.md` file with instructions for the specific JS kata.

> [!NOTE]  
> Unfortunately JS modules only work via HTTP(s), so for some Katas which are using JS modules you'll need to use a local web server.
