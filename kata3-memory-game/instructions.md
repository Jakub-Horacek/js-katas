# Instructions

Develop a memory game using JavaScript, focusing on array manipulation, DOM manipulation, and event handling, without relying heavily on HTML/CSS styling. The game involves flipping cards to find matching pairs.

- Create a grid layout with a set number of cards. Each card is initially face down.
- Every card has a matching pair. Pairs can be represented by numbers, colors, or simple shapes.
- The player clicks on two cards to flip them over.
- If the cards match, they remain face-up. If they don't, they flip back over after a short delay.
- The game tracks the number of attempts made and displays it.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched.
